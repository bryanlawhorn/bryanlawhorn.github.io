This is my first "post" on my new site.  Hello World!

Notes for Bryan below:

This is what a `code excerpt` looks like and how it is displayed.

If you want to include Ruby code in your site, Jekyll supports that, and can display it like this:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
